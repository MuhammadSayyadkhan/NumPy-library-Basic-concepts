### 1. Introduction to NumPy
Learn what NumPy is and why it’s used for scientific computing.
Understand arrays and how they are better than Python lists.
### 2. NumPy Functions
Explore built-in functions for creating arrays (zeros, ones, arange, linspace).
Learn how these functions make coding easier.
### 3. Random Numbers in NumPy
Generate random integers, floats, and samples.
Useful for simulations, testing, and machine learning.
### 4. Data Types in NumPy
Learn different data types (int, float, bool, complex).
How to check and change the type of an array.
### 5. Arithmetic Operations
Perform basic math (+, -, *, /) on arrays.
Fast and vectorized compared to Python loops.
### 6. Arithmetic Functions
Use functions like sum, mean, sqrt, exp.
Perform advanced math easily with NumPy.
### 7. Shape & Reshape
Check the size/shape of arrays.
Reshape arrays into different dimensions (e.g., 1D → 2D).
### 8. Broadcasting
Learn how NumPy handles operations between arrays of different shapes.
Very powerful for reducing code.
### 9. Indexing & Slicing
Access elements using indices.
Slice arrays to get subarrays.
### 10. Iteration with nditer
Loop through arrays efficiently.
Work with multi-dimensional arrays in simple ways.
### 11. Copy vs View
Understand the difference between copying an array and creating a view.
Important for memory management.
### 12. Concatenate, Stack & Split
Combine arrays (concatenate, stack).
Break arrays into smaller parts (split).
### 13. Searching Elements
Find elements using conditions.
Learn functions like where, searchsorted.
### 14. Shuffle & Unique
Shuffle elements randomly.
Find unique values in arrays.
### 15. Insert & Delete
Insert new elements into arrays.
Delete elements from arrays.
### 16. Matrix Functions
Work with matrices using functions like dot, transpose, inv.
Essential for linear algebra and machine learning.
